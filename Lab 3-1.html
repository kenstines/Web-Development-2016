			<p>It is time for our annual recycling drive! Recycling means taking a product or material at the end of its useful life and making it a usable raw material to make another product. We have been very successful with paper and plastic products. Last year, we recycled more items than our privious three yaers. Let's try to do it again this year. We will have a dinner for everyone invloved with the recycle drive on Saturday night. We hope to see you all there!  </P>

			<h2><a id="about">About Recycling</a></h2>
		</header>
		
			<p>The United States and several European countries lead the world in technology, excess and waste with the statistics regarding recycling being disappointing. Despite the education andawareness of global warming and the need to conserve Earths precious resources people world wide continue to live as if there is no limit to our space and to our resources. Although the most common recyclable items including glass, plastic, paper and aluminum are largely being sent to recycling centers there is room for improvement.The United States has finally reached a landmark in its paper recycling efforts in 2006 with 53.4% of the paper consumed being recovered for recycling. Recycling paper is not enough however; the recycling efforts on the whole throughout the world need to increase if we want to see a marked difference in our landfills, resources and global warming.A few interesting recycling and refuse related facts areoften a revelation to some.Did you know, the Hershey Company in the US produces about 20,000,000 kisses each day using 133 square miles of aluminum to wrap them in; this material is recyclable and most of it ends up in the trash rather than the recycle bin. Intersting facts! Another interesting fact that shows how recycling, or lack of it, has changed the face of the Earth is in regards to the highest point in Ohio US. It's a mountain but not as we know it! Mount Rumpke is the highest point in Ohio at over 1000 feet, it's no Mount Everest; however, Mount Everest is not made up entirely of garbage. Mount Rumpke is literally a mountain of trash and is located in the Rumpke landfill. Killing Our Trees,There are also some staggering and frightening facts regarding recycling that should cause any human living on this planet to increase their efforts to create positive change.Among these is the rate of the Rain Forests’ being cut down; this is a staggering 100 acres per minute! Statistically the United States recycles just about 28% of its waste today, which is doubled from what it was a decade ago. In Europe, Austria heads the EU in its recycling efforts with approximately 60% of its waste being recycled. Greece falls short with only 10% of its waste being recycled and the remaining 90% going to the landfills. Unfortunately many countries in the European Union as well as the United States efforts in recycling are more similar to Greece than they are to Austria. The UK is estimated to recycle about 17.7%, and Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Luxembourg being not too far behind. Save the trees  Even the most conscious minded person who fills their recycle bins each week may not realize the amount of recyclable material that is commonly thrown away in small ways. Motor Oil Contaminates. A rather frightening fact is in regards to the motor oil we use. Just one quart of motor oil that is disposed of improperly can contaminate up to 2,000,000 gallons of fresh water. Motor oil gets dirty but does not wear out. Oil too can be recycled by re-refining the oil it can be used again and again and can help to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. Finally, of all of the countries in the world and populations the United States makes up about 5% of the world’s population. The United States is also the world’s largest trash producing country at 1,609 pounds of trash per person per year. What this means is that just 5% of the world’s population produces about 40% of the worlds waste and with the total rate of recycling in the United States being only at about 28%; well, there is a great need for improvement. With the combined efforts of the European Commission and national governments as well as European paper makers the rate of paper recycling has greatly increased over the decade and is estimated to be over 54.6% today. As the demand for post consumer recycled products increases the products will be found in common shopping locations and competitively priced. By the year 2003, 200 California landfills will close. The County of Ventura has traditionally relied on one local landfill for waste disposal. Unlike landfills (which simply stockpile trash) recycling removes waste completely, then turns it back to useful products. Recycling saves money, and in turn reduces the amount of trash going to the landfills.
